# Silicone Oil

This repository contains a standalone generator for neutral PDMS oil, neutral
PMPS oil, and coarse-grained PDMS-PMPS copolymer oils. It was split from the
[`Oil` directory of Silicone_Coating](https://github.com/sitengz/Silicone_Coating/tree/main/Oil).
The generator and its configuration parser are self-contained; analyzers are
not included yet.

## Repository layout

```text
Generator/    oil generator and configuration parser
Analysis/     reserved for analyzers
simulations/  reserved for simulation cases
examples/     reserved for worked examples
model.conf    current editable generator configuration
```

The three reserved folders contain only short placeholders. Simulation cases,
examples, and analyzer code will be added later.

The generator writes four companion files for every case:

```text
data.<case>
in.<case>
submit.<case>.sh
<case>.info
```

The `.info` file is valid JSON and records the composition, realized MPS
monomer and weight percentages, type populations, topology counts, box size,
random seeds, mixing-rule choice, and Green-Kubo production settings. During
the LAMMPS run, a fifth file named `gk_stress.<case>.dat` is created for
viscosity analysis.

## Compile

From the repository root:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic \
    Generator/oil_generator.cpp -o Generator/oil_generator
```

The code is compatible with C++14 and newer compilers. C++17 can also be used.

## Configuration file

Edit [`model.conf`](model.conf) and run:

```bash
./Generator/oil_generator --config model.conf
```

The file uses `key = value` lines. Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored;
keys may use underscores or hyphens (for example, `mps_percent` or
`mps-percent`). All command-line options listed below are available as keys,
including `output`. Command-line values override the same keys in the file:

```bash
./Generator/oil_generator --config model.conf --chains 100
```

The included configuration describes 500 chains of 32 repeat units with 50%
MPS. The configuration path is resolved relative to the directory where the
generator is run. The existing command-line-only workflow remains available.

## Default model

Running without options:

```bash
./Generator/oil_generator
```

generates 625 PMPS oil chains with 16 MPS repeat units per chain:

```text
data.Oil_PMPS_N16_M625
in.Oil_PMPS_N16_M625
submit.Oil_PMPS_N16_M625.sh
Oil_PMPS_N16_M625.info
```

The default system contains 20,000 beads and reproduces the counts of the
supplied PMPS N16 model:

| Quantity | Count |
|---|---:|
| Atoms | 20,000 |
| Bonds | 19,375 |
| Angles | 27,500 |
| Dihedrals | 35,000 |

Unlike the old PMPS generator, the initial chains are non-collinear, molecules
are randomly rotated, every complete chain is placed wholly inside the primary
box with zero image flags, and intermolecular placements below 4.5 Å are
rejected. The default initial density is deliberately low at 0.1 g/cm³.

## Atom types

The combined type namespace is reserved now so that the oil can later be added
to V22 or V35 without renumbering:

| Atom type | Meaning | Mass (g/mol) | Used by oil-only generator |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Neutral DMS bead | 74.0 | Yes |
| 2 | Reactive DMS type from formulation model | 74.0 | Reserved |
| 3 | Reactive DMS type from formulation model | 74.0 | Reserved |
| 4 | MPS backbone bead | 59.1204 | Yes |
| 5 | MPS phenyl pendant bead | 77.106 | Yes |

One DMS repeat contains one type-1 bead and has a mass of 74.0 g/mol.

One MPS repeat contains one type-4 backbone bead plus one type-5 pendant bead:

```text
M(MPS repeat) = 59.1204 + 77.106 = 136.2264 g/mol
```

Types 2 and 3 have zero atoms in an oil-only system. They are retained in the
data-file header and pair matrix for compatibility with the formulation models.

## Temperature-dependent nonbonded interactions

All pair coefficients are calculated by the generator and written explicitly.
LAMMPS does not apply an automatic mixing rule.

The DMS-MPS combining rule is:

```text
epsilon(DMS,MPS) = 0.579966
                   * sqrt[epsilon(DMS,DMS) * epsilon(MPS,MPS)]
sigma(DMS,MPS)   = [sigma(DMS,DMS)   + sigma(MPS,MPS)]   / 2
```

The epsilon prefactor is applied to DMS interactions with both the MPS
backbone and MPS pendant beads, at both 300 K and 800 K.

The pure PMPS backbone-pendant term remains the supplied PMPS cross
interaction; it is not recalculated by the DMS-MPS combining rule.

### 300 K attractive matrix

At 300 K, the input uses:

```lammps
pair_style lj/gromacs 12 15
special_bonds lj 0 0 0.5
```

| Pair | Epsilon (kcal/mol) | Sigma (Å) | Source |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| DMS-DMS | 1.012878450 | 6.445843660 | V22/V35 DMS model |
| DMS-MPS backbone | 0.778707979 | 5.960508330 | 0.579966 × geometric ε; arithmetic σ |
| DMS-MPS pendant | 0.537772752 | 6.206674705 | 0.579966 × geometric ε; arithmetic σ |
| MPS backbone-backbone | 1.779864125 | 5.475173000 | PMPS model |
| MPS backbone-pendant | 1.331357250 | 5.727290650 | Supplied PMPS cross term |
| MPS pendant-pendant | 0.848858275 | 5.967505750 | PMPS model |

Types 1, 2, and 3 receive the same DMS nonbonded parameters. Therefore all
three types have the same combined interactions with types 4 and 5.

### 800 K repulsive matrix

The DMS parameters at 800 K are calculated with the same temperature equations
used by the V22/V35 generators. Because only 300 K PMPS parameters were
supplied, this standalone model applies the corresponding DMS temperature
ratios to each PMPS epsilon and sigma:

```text
epsilon_PMPS(800) = epsilon_PMPS(300)
                    * epsilon_DMS(800)/epsilon_DMS(300)

sigma_PMPS(800)   = sigma_PMPS(300)
                    * sigma_DMS(800)/sigma_DMS(300)
```

After scaling the pure PMPS terms, the mixed DMS-MPS values are recalculated
using `0.579966 ×` geometric epsilon and arithmetic sigma.

| Pair | Epsilon at 800 K | Sigma at 800 K (Å) | Repulsive cutoff (Å) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DMS-DMS | 0.531850637 | 6.640519401 | 7.453731009 |
| DMS-MPS backbone | 0.408890459 | 6.140526096 | 6.892507499 |
| DMS-MPS pendant | 0.282378187 | 6.394127126 | 7.177165031 |
| MPS backbone-backbone | 0.934585852 | 5.640532791 | 6.331283990 |
| MPS backbone-pendant | 0.699080133 | 5.900264835 | 6.622823352 |
| MPS pendant-pendant | 0.445725560 | 6.147734850 | 6.900599052 |

The high-temperature stage uses `pair_style lj/cut`. Every pair receives its
own cutoff at `2^(1/6)*sigma`, so only the repulsive-force side of that pair's
Lennard-Jones interaction is retained. The global cutoff is the largest
pair-specific value, 7.453731009 Å.

Both complete 800 K and 300 K matrices are also recorded in each `.info` file.

## Rough bonded model

The copolymer rule is implemented by inspecting every bonded interaction.

### Bonds

| Bond type | Interaction | Potential |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | DMS-DMS or mixed DMS-MPS backbone bond | DMS harmonic bond |
| 2 | MPS-MPS backbone bond | PMPS backbone harmonic bond |
| 3 | MPS backbone-pendant bond | PMPS pendant harmonic bond |

### Angles

| Angle type | Interaction | Potential |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Backbone-only angle containing at least one DMS repeat | DMS harmonic angle |
| 2 | Three MPS backbone beads | PMPS backbone quartic angle |
| 3 | Any angle containing an MPS pendant | PMPS pendant quartic angle |

### Dihedrals

| Dihedral type | Interaction | Potential |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Backbone-only dihedral containing at least one DMS repeat | DMS `nharmonic` |
| 2 | Four MPS backbone beads | PMPS backbone `nharmonic` |
| 3 | Dihedral containing one MPS pendant | PMPS one-pendant `nharmonic` |
| 4 | Dihedral containing two MPS pendants | PMPS two-pendant `nharmonic` |

Thus a mixed bonded interaction without a pendant follows the DMS model. Once
a pendant participates, it follows the corresponding PMPS rule.

The input uses:

```lammps
bond_style harmonic
angle_style hybrid harmonic quartic
dihedral_style nharmonic
```

## Composition controls

Every chain has the same number of DMS and MPS repeat units. For `random`
sequences, the positions vary between chains but the composition does not.

### Monomer percentage

Use `--mps-percent` to specify the percentage of repeat-unit positions that are
MPS:

```bash
./Generator/oil_generator \
    --length 32 \
    --chains 500 \
    --mps-percent 25 \
    --sequence random
```

This requests 8 MPS and 24 DMS repeat units per chain.

### Weight percentage

Use `--mps-wt` to choose the closest integer MPS count per chain based on the
different DMS and MPS repeat masses:

```bash
./Generator/oil_generator \
    --length 32 \
    --chains 500 \
    --mps-wt 40 \
    --sequence random
```

For a chain with `N` repeat positions and `k` MPS repeats:

```text
M_chain = (N-k)*74.0 + k*136.2264

MPS wt% = 100 * k*136.2264 / M_chain
```

Because `k` must be an integer, the realized weight percentage can differ from
the request. The generator reports both values and records them in `.info`.

`--mps-percent` and `--mps-wt` cannot be supplied together.

## Sequence modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `random` | Selects the exact requested number of MPS sites randomly and reproducibly on each chain |
| `alternating` | Distributes the MPS sites as evenly as possible along each chain |
| `block` | Places one contiguous MPS block in the middle of each chain |

Pure PDMS and pure PMPS chains are unaffected by the sequence choice.

Examples:

```bash
# Pure PDMS oil
./Generator/oil_generator --length 32 --chains 500 --mps-percent 0

# Pure PMPS oil
./Generator/oil_generator --length 16 --chains 625 --mps-percent 100

# Approximately alternating 50:50 copolymer
./Generator/oil_generator \
    --length 32 \
    --chains 500 \
    --mps-percent 50 \
    --sequence alternating

# Central PMPS block at a target MPS weight percentage
./Generator/oil_generator \
    --length 64 \
    --chains 250 \
    --mps-wt 30 \
    --sequence block
```

## Generated LAMMPS workflow

The companion input first follows the V22/V35 seven-million-step
equilibration structure without the crosslinking operation, then adds a
100 ns Green-Kubo production stage:

```text
1M  initial relaxation at 800 K
1M  isotropic compression at 800 K
1M  relaxation at the compressed dimensions
2M  extended equilibration at 800 K
1M  cooling from 800 K to 300 K under isotropic NPT
1M  final 300 K equilibration under isotropic NPT
20M  100 ns viscosity production at 300 K under NVT
```

Before dynamics, the input minimizes the structure and creates 800 K
velocities. With the default initial and target densities, each box dimension
is scaled by:

```text
(0.1/0.8)^(1/3) = 0.5
```

The high-temperature repulsive matrix is active for the first five million
steps. The input then switches to the explicit 300 K `lj/gromacs` matrix before
cooling. The timestep is 5 fs, matching the V22/V35 workflow. The complete
workflow is 27 million steps: 7 million equilibration steps followed by
20 million production steps.

### Green-Kubo stress output

After the final 300 K NPT equilibration, the barostat is removed and the final
equilibrated volume is held fixed for a 100 ns NVT trajectory at 300 K. The
production timestep counter and accumulated time are reset to zero.

The atom-coordinate dump is stopped before this long production stage. Instead,
LAMMPS writes the instantaneous off-diagonal pressure components every 10
timesteps, corresponding to a 50 fs sampling interval:

```text
gk_stress.<case>.dat
```

The file has one header followed by exactly four columns:

```text
# time_fs pxy_atm pxz_atm pyz_atm
```

Thus a completed 100 ns run contains 2,000,000 stress samples. The pressure
components are in atmospheres because the input uses LAMMPS `real` units. No
time averaging is applied before writing, preserving the instantaneous stress
series needed for Green-Kubo autocorrelation analysis.

The generated Slurm script still requests 48 hours. Confirm from the shorter
equilibration tests that 27 million steps fit within that wall time; otherwise,
increase the Slurm time request within the limits of the selected Nova
partition.

The Slurm script uses the same Nova module configuration and quoted output
redirection as the tested V22/V35 scripts:

```bash
sbatch submit.<case>.sh
```

## Scope of this version

This version generates periodic bulk oil only. It does not:

- generate film geometry or walls;
- create reactive oil end groups;
- infer any mixing rule other than the explicitly documented
  `0.579966 ×` geometric-epsilon, arithmetic-sigma DMS-MPS rule.

## Generated file descriptions

- `data.<case>` is the initial LAMMPS data file containing the periodic box,
  oil atoms, and bonded topology.
- `in.<case>` is the complete LAMMPS workflow for 800 K relaxation and
  compression, cooling, 300 K equilibration, and the 100 ns Green-Kubo NVT
  production run.
- `submit.<case>.sh` is the one-node, 96-task Slurm submission script.
- `<case>.info` is a JSON manifest containing composition, sequence,
  force-field, topology, random-seed, and production settings.
- `gk_stress.<case>.dat` is created during the LAMMPS run and contains
  `time_fs`, `pxy`, `pxz`, and `pyz` for viscosity analysis.
